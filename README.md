# Sign-up Form

This project is a sign-up form page, created as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinsprogram.com/) curriculum. The main goal is to practice building forms with HTML5 and styling them with modern CSS, including providing feedback for form validation.

## ✨ Features

- A clean, two-column layout using CSS Flexbox.
- Custom-styled form inputs.
- Client-side form validation using HTML5 attributes (`required`, `minlength`, etc.).
- Visual feedback for input fields based on their validation state (`:valid`, `:invalid`) and focus (`:focus`).
